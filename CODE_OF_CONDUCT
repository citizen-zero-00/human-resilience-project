## Purpose

This repository exists to host an experimental framework for human societies.
Discussions here must reflect the same principles of safety, dignity, and restraint
defined in the PRH documents.

This Code of Conduct applies to:
- issues
- pull requests
- discussions
- comments
- external references directly related to the repository

---

## Expected Behavior

Participants are expected to:

- engage respectfully and critically
- challenge ideas, not individuals
- accept disagreement without escalation
- avoid moral superiority or ideological coercion
- respect anonymity and privacy
- recognize limits of their own perspective

Silence, restraint, and clarity are valued.

---

## Unacceptable Behavior

The following behaviors are not tolerated:

- harassment or intimidation
- personal attacks
- ideological enforcement
- sustained hostile behavior
- attempts to dominate discussion
- doxxing or identity speculation
- pressuring contributors to disclose personal information

Intent does not override impact.

---

## Moderation Principles

Moderation exists to:
- preserve safety
- prevent escalation
- protect participation

Moderators:
- are functionally appointed
- operate transparently
- do not enforce ideology
- may step down at any time

---

## Reporting

Concerns may be reported via:
- GitHub reporting tools
- repository maintainers (anonymously if possible)

Retaliation against reporters is strictly prohibited.

---

## Enforcement

Consequences may include:
- warnings
- temporary restrictions
- removal from discussions

Permanent bans require clear documentation.

---

## Final Clause

A project that cannot host disagreement
without hostility
has already failed its own principles.
