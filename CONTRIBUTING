Contribution is not about agreement.
It is about strengthening the framework.

- identifying contradictions
- proposing alternative mechanisms
- stress-testing assumptions
- suggesting clarifications
- reporting risks or blind spots

You do not need to support PRH to contribute.

- Be precise and concrete
- Avoid vague moral claims

- One proposal per pull request

---

## How to Contribute

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a branch with a clear name
3. Make your changes
4. Open a Pull Request explaining:
   - what problem you are addressing
   - which document is affected
   - potential risks introduced

---

## Review Process

- All pull requests are reviewed
- Requests may be challenged or rejected
- Rejection does not imply hostility

No contribution is guaranteed acceptance.

---

## Anonymity

Anonymous contributions are permitted.
Identity disclosure is not required.

---

## Scope Control

PRH is an experimental framework.
Requests that attempt to:
- add ideology
- centralize authority
- remove exit rights
- enforce belief

will be rejected.

## Final Clause

Contribution is voluntary.
Silence is always an acceptable choice.
