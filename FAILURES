# Expected Failures and Blind Spots

PRH assumes failure as part of the experiment.

## Known Risks

- informal power accumulation
- moral conformity pressure
- psychological isolation
- founder dependency
- generational ideological inheritance
- silent suffering minorities

## This project survives only if:
- dissent is protected
- exit is honorable
- children can reject PRH
- no individual becomes irreplaceable

Any proposal that removes these safeguards must be rejected.
