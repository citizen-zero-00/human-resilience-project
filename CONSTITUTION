## Preamble

The Human Resilience Project (PRH) is an experimental framework for testing the long-term viability of small-scale human societies operating without political authority, religious leadership, or market-based competition.

This Constitution defines the **non-negotiable principles** of PRH.  
They are designed to prevent concentration of power, systemic abuse, and ideological capture.

No rule, coordinator, council, or majority decision may override this document.
