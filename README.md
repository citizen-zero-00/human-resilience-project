# Human Resilience Project (PRH)

**Version:** v0.1  
**Status:** Experimental  
**Author:** PRH Collective

The Human Resilience Project (PRH) is an open experimental framework for the creation of small-scale, resilient, self-regulated human communities.

PRH is not a utopia.  
It is a controlled experiment designed to explore how human societies behave when:
- there is no political power
- there is no religious authority
- there is no market competition
- there is no social class
- survival infrastructure already exists

Participation is voluntary.  
Exit is always allowed.

This repository documents the **first public draft** of the experiment.
