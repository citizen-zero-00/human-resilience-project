# PRH Selection Framework
Human Resilience Project (PRH)

Version: v0.1  
Status: Mandatory  
Purpose: Risk reduction, not optimization  

---

## 1. Principle

Selection in PRH is not about excellence, purity, ideology, or virtue.

It exists to:
- reduce predictable failure
- protect participants
- preserve the experiment

Selection is a **safety mechanism**, not a reward.

---

## 2. Voluntary Participation

1. All participation is voluntary.
2. No moral framing of acceptance or rejection is permitted.
3. Rejection does not imply deficiency or judgment.
4. No social or reputational consequence may follow rejection.

---

## 3. What PRH Selects For

PRH prioritizes:

- emotional regulation capacity
- tolerance to frustration
- ability to receive feedback
- respect for boundaries
- non-coercive behavior
- cognitive flexibility
- cooperation under non-hierarchical systems

High intelligence alone is insufficient.

---

## 4. What PRH Screens Against

PRH explicitly screens for **risk patterns**, not identities.

Examples:
- repeated dominance behavior
- inability to accept role rotation
- chronic boundary violations
- dependency-seeking behavior
- moral absolutism
- refusal to accept exit as legitimate

Screening is probabilistic, not deterministic.

---

## 5. Diversity as Stress Test

PRH actively includes:
- diverse personalities
- different cultural backgrounds
- varied cognitive profiles
- difficult but non-violent individuals

Homogeneity increases fragility.

---

## 6. Evaluation Process

Selection may include:
- interviews
- group simulations
- stress scenarios
- peer observation
- external psychological assessment

No single evaluator decides.

---

## 7. Probation Period

All participants enter under a probation phase.

- duration: defined and transparent
- exit without penalty guaranteed
- reassignment allowed
- no permanent role assignment

Probation protects both sides.

---

## 8. No Permanent Acceptance

Participation is continuously reaffirmed.

- roles rotate
- functions change
- reassessment is periodic

PRH is not a lifetime contract.

---

## 9. Ethical Boundary

PRH does not:
- select based on belief
- enforce ideology
- require identity alignment

Behavior is the only criterion.

---

## Final Clause

Selection exists to prevent predictable harm,
not to engineer ideal humans.

Any selection process that produces fear
has already failed.
