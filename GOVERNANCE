# PRH Governance Framework
Human Resilience Project (PRH)

Version: v0.1  
Status: Mandatory  
Model: Coordination without Authority  

---

## 1. Governance Philosophy

PRH rejects:
- political power
- religious authority
- charismatic leadership
- hierarchy as control

PRH adopts:
- coordination
- transparency
- redundancy
- reversibility

Governance exists to prevent collapse, not to rule.

---

## 2. Roles vs Power

PRH distinguishes strictly between:
- **role** (temporary function)
- **power** (capacity to impose outcomes)

Roles never accumulate power.

---

## 3. Functional Structure

Roles include:
- coordinators
- supervisors
- operators
- analysts
- facilitators

All roles are:
- time-limited
- performance-reviewed
- rotative
- replaceable

No role is permanent.

---

## 4. Rotation Rules

- Maximum tenure per role: defined and enforced
- Mandatory rest period between reappointments
- No consecutive occupation of critical roles

Rotation prevents capture.

---

## 5. Councils

### Purpose
- conflict mediation
- system review
- safety oversight

### Rules
- minimum 5 members
- random or semi-random selection
- limited mandate
- no executive power

Councils cannot legislate ideology.

---

## 6. Decision-Making Model

PRH uses layered decision-making:

1. Local decisions at lowest possible level
2. Escalation only when necessary
3. Documentation mandatory
4. Reversibility prioritized over optimization

No decision is irreversible.

---

## 7. Dual Control Principle

All critical systems require:
- at least two trained operators
- mutual verification
- independent logging

Pilot and co-pilot logic applies universally.

---

## 8. Prevention of Informal Elites

Warning signs:
- people others “always consult”
- individuals exempt from rotation
- fear of contradicting someone
- excessive moral authority

These trigger governance review.

---

## 9. Transparency and Records

- All decisions documented
- All processes auditable
- No closed-door governance

Opacity is a failure mode.

---

## 10. Governance Failure Protocol

If governance itself becomes harmful:
1. External mediation is mandatory
2. Roles are frozen
3. Temporary dissolution of structures is allowed
4. Exit routes must be reinforced

Governance must never defend itself at the cost of people.

---

## 11. Non-Ideal Participants

PRH assumes:
- difficult personalities exist
- conflicts are inevitable
- harmony is not guaranteed

Governance is designed for real humans, not ideal ones.

---

## Final Clause

If governance becomes necessary to preserve itself,
it must be dismantled.

A system that cannot question itself
has already become authoritarian.
