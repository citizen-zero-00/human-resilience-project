# PRH Children and Future Generations Framework
Human Resilience Project (PRH)

Version: v0.1  
Status: Mandatory  
Scope: Protection, autonomy, exposure  

---

## 1. Foundational Principle

Children are not participants in an experiment.

They are individuals under protection.

---

## 2. Non-Inheritance of Commitment

1. Children do not inherit PRH membership.
2. No ideological loyalty is expected.
3. No moral obligation to continue exists.

PRH may not reproduce itself through children.

---

## 3. Education

Children must receive:
- full secular education
- access to external knowledge
- exposure to non-PRH societies
- critical thinking training

Education must include criticism of PRH itself.

---

## 4. Identity and Belief

Children may:
- adopt or reject beliefs freely
- explore identities
- question all structures

No belief enforcement is permitted.

---

## 5. External Contact

Children must have:
- access to external adults
- exposure to alternative lifestyles
- uncensored information (age-appropriate)

Isolation is prohibited.

---

## 6. Psychological Safeguards

PRH must provide:
- independent child psychologists
- confidential reporting channels
- early intervention protocols

Children cannot be expected to self-protect.

---

## 7. Transition to Adulthood

Before adulthood:
- explicit orientation on exit rights
- practical preparation for external life
- financial and logistical literacy

Leaving must be viable, not symbolic.

---

## 8. Failure Clause

If PRH cannot guarantee:
- autonomy
- safety
- informed consent

it must suspend reproduction or dissolve.

---

## Final Clause

A society that requires children
to justify its existence
has already lost moral legitimacy.
