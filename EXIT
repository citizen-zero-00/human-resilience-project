# Exit Protocol

Participation in PRH is voluntary at all times.

Any participant may leave:
- without justification
- without moral judgment
- without loss of dignity

Exit procedures must:
- preserve family bonds
- ensure safe reintegration
- include a formal farewell ritual

A society that punishes exit is not resilient.
