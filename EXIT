# PRH Exit Protocol
Human Resilience Project (PRH)

Version: v0.1  
Status: Immutable  
Purpose: Prevent coercion and hidden captivity  

---

## 1. Exit as Absolute Right

The right to exit PRH is unconditional.

- no justification required
- no moral questioning
- no waiting period imposed

Exit is not failure.

---

## 2. Exit Modalities

Exit may occur:
- immediately
- gradually
- temporarily
- permanently

Re-entry is possible under standard selection rules.

---

## 3. Exit Support

PRH must provide:
- logistical support when feasible
- documentation access
- personal records
- neutral references if requested

Exit shall not create vulnerability.

---

## 4. Psychological Safety During Exit

PRH explicitly prohibits:
- emotional pressure
- guilt framing
- social isolation
- narrative of betrayal

Language matters.

---

## 5. Protection Against Retaliation

Any retaliation following exit:
- triggers governance review
- invalidates involved roles
- is treated as safety violation

---

## 6. Exit from Roles vs Exit from PRH

Leaving a role ≠ leaving PRH.

Participants may:
- step down
- pause
- change functions

Role exhaustion is expected.

---

## 7. Involuntary Separation

Temporary removal from function may occur for safety reasons.

This is not expulsion.

Permanent exclusion is:
- rare
- documented
- externally reviewed

---

## 8. Children and Exit

Children reaching adulthood:
- are fully informed
- have unrestricted exit rights
- receive external exposure before decision

Consent cannot be inherited.

---

## Final Clause

A system that cannot be left
is indistinguishable from a prison,
regardless of its intentions.
