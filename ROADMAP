# PRH Roadmap
Human Resilience Project (PRH)

Version: v0.1  
Horizon: 50+ years  
Scope: Experimental, scalable, reversible  

---

## Phase 0 — Conceptual Validation (Year -2 to 0)

**Objective:**  
Test intellectual, ethical, and systemic coherence before physical implementation.

### Actions
- Public release of PRH v0.1
- Open critique by external experts
- Failure-mapping workshops
- Ethical stress-testing
- Host country legal validation

### Exit Criteria
- Clear identification of fatal flaws
- Confirmation of legal feasibility
- Minimum interdisciplinary interest

---

## Phase 1 — Pilot Community (Years 0–5)

**Population:** 100–200 participants  
**Location:** Rural or semi-rural, legally compliant  

### Objectives
- Test coordination without authority
- Validate safety mechanisms
- Observe early power emergence
- Evaluate exit protocols

### Infrastructure
- Water, sanitation, energy redundancy
- Manual + automated systems
- Central documentation servers
- Communal and private spaces

### Metrics
- Exit frequency
- Conflict resolution time
- Psychological well-being indicators
- Knowledge redundancy index

---

## Phase 2 — Expanded Village (Years 5–15)

**Population:** 500–800 participants  

### Objectives
- Multi-generational interaction
- Children education systems
- Specialized research roles
- Cultural diversification

### Focus Areas
- Rotational labor systems
- Skill decay prevention
- Long-term relationship stability
- Cognitive overload detection

### Failure Watch
- informal elites
- moral conformity pressure
- silent burnout

---

## Phase 3 — Replication (Years 15–40)

**Objective:**  
Test whether PRH can replicate without ideological drift.

### Actions
- Design of second and third villages
- Independent governance structures
- Controlled divergence experiments
- Inter-village exchange protocols

### Metrics
- Rule drift index
- Coordination efficiency
- Cross-village conflict rates

---

## Phase 4 — Long-Term Observation (Years 40–100)

**Objective:**  
Observe generational stability and adaptability.

### Focus
- Children born inside PRH reaching adulthood
- Voluntary retention rates
- Knowledge transmission fidelity
- Resistance to mythologization

---

## Phase 5 — Termination or Evolution (100+ Years)

PRH must choose between:
1. **Orderly dissolution**
2. **Transformation into a new legal form**
3. **Continuation under renewed constitutional validation**

Continuation without revalidation is forbidden.

---

## Success Criteria

PRH is successful if it:
- can dissolve without violence
- allows individuals to leave whole
- never requires belief to function
- remains compatible with external society

A system that cannot end has already become a prison.
