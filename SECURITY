## Purpose

Security in PRH includes:
- technical security
- social safety
- psychological integrity
- governance resilience

This file concerns repository-level risks.

---

## Reporting Vulnerabilities

If you identify:
- abusive behavior
- coercive language patterns
- attempts to centralize authority
- threats (explicit or implicit)
- documentation that enables harm

Please report via GitHub or contact maintainers.

---

## What Not to Report Here

- ideological disagreement
- moral objections
- theological critique

Those belong in issues or discussions.

---

## Response Commitment

All security-related reports will be:
- acknowledged
- reviewed
- documented

Silence is not an acceptable response.

---

## Final Clause

Security failures are not shameful.
Ignoring them is.
